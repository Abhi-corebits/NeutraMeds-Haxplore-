               <p>iBuiltThis is a community-driven app where creators share what they’re building—big or small. From side projects and startups to experiments, prototypes, and passion projects, iBuiltThis is a place to show your work, learn from others, and get inspired.</p>

                <p>This platform is a personal learning project built to explore how developers present their work beyond resumes. The goal is to experiment with structured project storytelling — focusing on problems, technical decisions, and trade-offs — to improve how projects are discussed during interviews.</p>

                <p>This website is a learning project created to practice full-stack development and product design.</p>
